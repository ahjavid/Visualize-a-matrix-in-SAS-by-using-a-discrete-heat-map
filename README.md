# Visualize-a-matrix-in-SAS-by-using-a-discrete-heat-map

A heat map is a graphical representation of a matrix that uses colors to
represent values in the matrix cells. Heat maps often reveal the
structure of a matrix. There are three common applications of
visualizing matrices with heat maps:

-   Visualizing a correlation or covariance matrix reveals relationships
    between variables. Chris Hemedinger has written an article that
    describes how to visualize correlation matrices by using a heat map.

-   Visualizing a data matrix reveals outliers, missingness patterns,
    and more.

-   A Matrix is usually visualized by using a color ramp with a
    continuous color gradient. If the matrix contains a small number of
    discrete values, it is preferable to use a discrete palette of
    colors. Heat maps with discrete color palettes are useful for
    visualizing structured covariance matrices and the nonzero pattern
    of sparse matrices.

Here are some examples :)
